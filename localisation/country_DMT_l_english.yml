 #### IDEAS ####
 DMT_revanchism:0 "Revanchism"
 DMT_revanchism_desc:0 "A few decades ago, the griffons of Hellquill did the unthinkable. They breached the impenetrable walls of Diamond Mountain and sacked the city, making off with the King's Horde. This act of humiliation has remained in the hearts and minds of Diamond Dogs everywhere and will not be extinguished until Hellquill pays."

 ### Focuses ###
 #Fascist
 DMT_in_the_hall_of_the_mountain_king:0 "In the Hall of the Mountain King"
 DMT_in_the_hall_of_the_mountain_king_desc:0 "Deep in Diamond Mountain, the Great Hall of our King resides. Here he rules over all who live under the mountains. It is time to start taking care of some unfinished business, if we are to reform the Dogs into a force capable of beating the treacherous griffon thieves."

 DMT_no_stone_left_unturned:0 "No Stone Left Unturned"
 DMT_no_stone_left_unturned_desc:0 "When the despicable knights, who seem to have no idea how property works, stole our most precious hoard, we have been looking for more precious stones. The first step to getting our gold and gems back is scouring the country for more crystal deposits. We are good at mining, let us play to our strength."

 DMT_greed_is_good:0 "Greed is Good"
 DMT_greed_is_good_desc:0 "The ponies of the Riverlands do not understand true value. They can probably not tell a ruby from a sapphire. We dogs know what is important in life, Wealth! The more we have of it, the better life is. We should not be ashamed to be greedy, we should be proud to say; More. More! MORE!"`

 DMT_dig_deep:0 "Delve Deep"
 DMT_dig_deep_desc:0 "There is no reason to not dig as deep as we can. The deeper we go, the more expensive materials we will find. We have the technology and the slaves to make it happen, so let us see what lies beneath. There are some legends about an ancient darkness from a bygone era lying beneath the mountain, however, those are merely tales they tell to little cubs to make them sleep at night."

 DMT_dig_smart:0 "Delve Smart"
 DMT_dig_smart_desc:0 "Instead of risking the depths of the roots of the Earth, let us instead focus on increasing the output from the deposits we already found. Going too far down there is risky and we don’t even know for sure if we will find any good materials down there. By expanding our current mining operations, we will have more than enough materials to make a grand army!"

 DMT_refilling_the_treasury:0 "Refill the Treasury"
 DMT_refilling_the_treasury_desc:0 "With our new mines up and running, we will finally be able to spare some materials to fill our coffers. The poor grand treasury was so empty it was simply depressing. Although it is nothing like the hoard we used to possess, we will create a pile of riches worthy of respect. All dogs will know that the King is still fabulously rich."

 DMT_crackdown_on_dissent:0 "Crackdown on Dissent"
 DMT_crackdown_on_dissent_desc:0 "Apparently the slaves have been gossiping about revolt and revolution. They do not understand their place in life. No matter, the King will show what happens when anydog dares defy the right of the strongest. These slaves will know who is the King under the Mountain!"

 DMT_abandon_the_ponies:0 "The Lone Dog"
 DMT_abandon_the_ponies_desc:0 "The differences between us and the ponies are simply too big. Most of them do not understand the value of riches and power. If we are not careful, the judgemental equines will start to interfere with our very way of life. They will consider slavery ‘unethical’ and mining ‘not environmentally friendly’. It is clear that the only canine nation must forge its own path as the Lone Dog of Griffonia."

 DMT_stick_with_the_treaty:0 "Keep our Word"
 DMT_stick_with_the_treaty_desc:0 "We are different than the ponies, but that does not mean we cannot work with them. They have knowledge we lack and some of them seem to be still seeking revenge against the Griffons as well. Besides, there is little more valuable than a dog’s worth. If we are to keep it that way, we better make sure we honour our deals."

 DMT_revenge:0 "Revenge"
 DMT_revenge_desc:0 "Do we still need to tell others this? During the reign of Tug the Boneless, King Rover’s father, the griffons of Hellquill broke into our mountain and had the audacity to steal OUR TREASURE. Now that we have taken care of things back home, we will be coming for their heads and our gold. And guess what? We will be taking all of their gold too!"

 DMT_revenge_achieved:0 "Revenge Achieved!"
 DMT_revenge_achieved_desc:0 "We have done it! Let us cheer for our glorious King, as Rover Diamondshield. The pride of his family and all Dogs has been restored! Let us begin the monumental task of cataloguing and transporting our gold, jewels and artefacts back to the Mountain and the impenetrable treasury. Afterwards, we can celebrate the return of our gold!"

 DMT_bring_the_lords_to_heel:0 "Bring the Lords to Heel"
 DMT_bring_the_lords_to_heel_desc:0 "Some of the Lords of smaller settlements have been criticising Rover for the dissent amongst the slaves and openly questioning whether his family is fit to rule under the Mountain. Anydog who dares question Rover Diamondshield will have to back up his words by deeds. We will see how these Lords bark if Rover challenges them to a duel! With a bit of threatening these dogs will also learn their place."

 DMT_work_the_slaves_harder:0 "Work the Slaves Harder"
 DMT_work_the_slaves_harder_desc:0 "The slaves have been complaining about their fate a lot more recently. If they still have the time and breath to think about revolting, they clearly have it too easy! We will tell our houndmasters to work these miserable weak dogs harder, so that the rest of us can benefit!"
 
 DMT_expand_slave_army:0 "Press more Slaves into Service"
 DMT_expand_slave_army_desc:0 "We could do with more soldiers, but not all freedogs are enthusiastic at the thought of being killed in combat. It doesn’t matter, we can always force more slaves to serve in our army, so we can increase our fighting power significantly!"

 DMT_fight_for_your_freedom:0 "A Way towards Freedom"
 DMT_fight_for_your_freedom_desc:0 "All those who prove themselves in combat, should have the chance to become freedogs. Our slavery system is based on enslaving those we deem the weakest after all. So a strong soldier should be rewarded with freedom. This system should seem fair to a lot of dogs, helping to improve army morale."

 DMT_long_live_the_king:0 "Long Live the King!"
 DMT_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "We should celebrate our valiant and glorious King Rover Diamondshield. He has shown that he is indeed the one True King under the Mountain. The strongest and most cunning canine on the continent! If we all rally behind him, he will lead us to untold riches."

#Harmony
 DMT_the_princess_regent:0 "The Princess Regent"
 DMT_the_princess_regent_desc:0 "Due to the recent unrest, King Rover Diamondshield has decided to take a step back. His daughter, Princess Molly will now try her paw at governing. She has promised to listen to the slaves’ concerns and reform society to resemble the ponies’ harmonic model. The Diamond Mountain looks forward with nervous expectation at the Princess Regent’s next steps."

 DMT_befriend_the_kings_supporters:0 "Befriend the Kingsdogs"
 DMT_befriend_the_kings_supporters_desc:0 "The top dogs in to the old system benefitted off the exploitation of others. Instead of alienating them, we should reach out our paw in friendship. Only by working together can our country grow to its full potential, so that everydog can live a good life!"

 DMT_the_emancipation_proclamation:0 "The Emancipation Proclamation"
 DMT_the_emancipation_proclamation_desc:0 "’’That on the first day of January, all beings held as slaves within our nation, shall be thenceforward and forever free; and the Government of Diamond Mountain, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such beings and will do no act or acts to repress such beings, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.”"

 DMT_open_up_the_mountain:0 "Open Up the Mountain"
 DMT_open_up_the_mountain_desc:0 "For too long we have jealously guarded our wealth. Our closemindedness and unwillingness to work together made us vulnerable to the Knights of Hellquill. If we open up the Mountain for trade and commerce with the rest of our pony friends, we can trade for useful things. By sharing our wealth, Diamond Mountain will prosper once more!"

 DMT_a_new_mountain:0 "A New Mountain"
 DMT_a_new_mountain_desc:0 "The dogs are beginning to understand the worth of freedom and harmony. Of cooperation and friendship! The once grim and dark halls of the Mountain King are now lit up by smiles. The weak, who once cowered in fear of being enslaved or abused, now proudly and confidently live their lives, knowing that we dogs look out for each other now."

 DMT_bill_of_rights:0 "The Bill of Rights"
 DMT_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "We must pen down some amendments to the Constitution which shall enshrine protections for everydog for future generations. Including the right to a fair trial, the right to the privacy of homes and that the government isn’t allowed to do everything without permission from the mountaindwellers themselves, except if it has been clearly written down before ."

 DMT_time_to_moeve_on:0 "Time to Move On"
 DMT_time_to_moeve_on_desc:0 "We shouldn’t keep ourselves stuck on grudges from the past. Of course it would be nice to get our treasure back, but by fixating on revenge, we have forgotten what is truly important. The real treasures underneath Diamond Mountain aren’t the ores, or even the gems. The treasures are the lights of the dogs themselves and we should take care of them!"

 DMT_rebuild_the_holds:0 "Reubild the Holds"
 DMT_rebuild_the_holds_desc:0 "Many of the Holds are underdeveloped or still devastated from the Knights’ attacks so many years ago. With everything in order and stable, we can start working on the rest of our country, turning every hold into a marvel of dog architecture!"

 DMT_free_schoolbooks:0 "Free Schoolbooks"
 DMT_free_schoolbooks_desc:0 "A free population is a well-educated one, but sadly many dogs have never taken the time to learn how to read. By providing free schoolbooks and starting reading classes, we can slowly bring our dogs into the modern age. Of course our books will not only teach about mathematics and history, but also about friendship and democracy!"

 DMT_an_army_of_freedom:0 "An Army of Freedom"
 DMT_an_army_of_freedom_desc:0 "Former slaves that used to be in the army can be recruited back on free and equal terms! Our dogs are so excited to march out of our Mountain and spread freedom far and wide. We need to act upon that enthusiasm and enlarge the Royal Army."

 DMT_tax_reform:0 "Reform the Tax Code"
 DMT_tax_reform_desc:0 "The tax code is horribly inefficient and confusing. It is full of tax breaks for certain clans the Kings of the past tried to appease, meaning that the actual income we get from taxes is abysmally low. By going through the document and actually getting rid of all these loopholes, we can improve tax collection significantly, while actually making the system fairer."

 DMT_free_the_north:0 "Free the North"
 DMT_free_the_north_desc:0 "The ponies to the North are being oppressed by slavery to the state! We cannot allow our friends to be chained and used in some evil government’s plan. We will show those evil ponies that we are not all bark and no bite. For Freedom!"

 DMT_harmony_beyond_the_mountain:0 "Harmony Beyond the Mountain"
 DMT_harmony_beyond_the_mountain_desc:0 "There are many conflicts in the world, and sadly we can’t help everydog. But by sending our dogs out as volunteers for the righteous, just maybe we can help to make the world a better place."

 #Industry
 DMT_begin_industralisation:0 "Begin Reindustrialisation"
 DMT_begin_industralisation_desc:0 "The mountains are home to great forges and builders, but we have grown stagnent in recent years. It's time to reinvigerate the dogs to relight the forges and return us to the industrial capital we once where."

 DMT_rebuild_the_lower_quaters:0 "Rebuild the Lower Quarters"
 DMT_rebuild_the_lower_quaters_desc:0 "The Lower Quarters of Diamond Mountain has been in ruins ever since Hellquil sacked the city. It's time to finaly rebuild those old halls and make them fit for anydog."

 DMT_expand_the_craftforges:0 "Expand the Craft-Forges"
 DMT_expand_the_craftforges_desc:0 "The Craft-Forges make all sorts of trinkets and goods for the dogs of the mountain. We should encourage them to expand their operations."

 DMT_expand_the_warfroges:0 "Expand the War-Forges"
 DMT_expand_the_warfroges_desc:0 "The War-Forges make the finest swords and muskets money could buy. We should encourage them to expand their operations."

 DMT_open_the_oil_wells:0 "Tap into the Oil"
 DMT_open_the_oil_wells_desc:0 "They call it black gold. Gold is good. We should get more of it."

 DMT_the_search_for_new_tresures:0 "The Search for New Tresures"
 DMT_the_search_for_new_tresures_desc:0 "There's more to gold and gems in these mountains. We just need to find them."

 DMT_crystals_for_the_warlock_engineers:0 "Crystals for the Warlock-Engineers"
 DMT_crystals_for_the_warlock_engineers_desc:0 "The Warlock-Engineers of Clan Azar-Dun meld sorcery and science until the two are undisguisable. Metal and crystals are fused with their flesh and crackle with archaic energies. Their voices twisted by the electric masks their wear. For long they have been at the edge of Diamond Dog society, but with a steady offering of crystals we can persuade the clan to share their secrets with the rest of the Kingdom."

 DMT_underground_rail_network:0 "Expand the Underground Railway"
 DMT_underground_rail_network_desc:0 "The Underground Railway connects all the great holds, but many of the lesser holds are left alone. We should make sure that every hold is in close access to a train."

 DMT_all_roads_lead_to_the_mountain:0 "All Roads Lead to the Mountain"
 DMT_all_roads_lead_to_the_mountain_desc:0 "Diamond Mountain is the centre of our relam. No matter where you are, you should be able to get there."

 DMT_the_fires_of_industry:0 "The Fires of Industry"
 DMT_the_fires_of_industry_desc:0 "Industry is in the heart and blood of every Diamond Dog. This passion for forging must be embraced."

 DMT_industrial_revolution:0 "Industrial Revolution"
 DMT_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "We have grown beyond crafthounds and their family forges. Now great forges where all dogs work line the lower levels of the halls, supplying us with whatever we need."

 DMT_empower_clan_azar_dun:0 "Empower Clan Azar-Dun"
 DMT_empower_clan_azar_dun_desc:0 "While they are still feared, Warlock-Engineers of Clan Azar-Dun are now a common site in the great halls of our mountains. We should seek to encourage further interactions to ensure everydog can benefit form their science."

 DMT_science_without_a_cause:0 "Science Without a Cause"
 DMT_science_without_a_cause_desc:0 "Who needs a reason for Science? Science for the sake of science is the key to a better future."

 DMT_fulfil_our_potential:0 "Fulfil our Potential"
 DMT_fulfil_our_potential_desc:0 "When outsides look upon the mountain, they shall see our golden doors and the smoke of our forges. They cannot help but gaze in wonder at the gold that flows into our halls, only to be shaped by our desires and never seen by outsiders again."
