Over the last few decades its influence among the citizens and the government has grown, leading to the generals having considerable sway over the government and the government powerless to do anything about it. LCA troops can be seen in every city, their proud, grey uniforms adorned with flowers from passing supporters. Ponies cheer and wave military flags as they march by.

 #### FOCUS ####


###Princely Restoration
 LCT_princely_restoration:0 "Princely Restoration"
 LCT_princely_restoration_desc:0 "In 852, Grand Princess Raging Breeze was deposed in a popular revolution. What followed was a century-and-a-half of feeble democratic rule, with the Ponies of Lake City carried from one crisis to the next. Thankfully, recent events have seen these wrongs corrected, and the reigns of power returned to Lake City's rightful sovereign, Grand Prince Heavenly Snow."

 LCT_long_live_the_prince:0 "Long Live the Prince"
 LCT_long_live_the_prince_desc:0 "While members of the Grand Prince's privy council privately question his qualifications, Heavenly Snow assures his ministers that he is fully capable of handling the affairs of state on his own. This is a bit of a shocking revelation, considering the Prince's initial reluctance to the coup. However, none will openly criticize such a decision."

 LCT_prince_of_the_people:0 "Prince of the People"
 LCT_prince_of_the_people_desc:0 "The idea of an opulent monarch, in a land ravaged by poverty, unemployment, and homelessness might rub many the wrong way. However, Grand Prince Heavenly Snow has continued to live his previous life, living well within the means of an average citizen. This example of self-sacrifice is seen as humbling, and has done much to bridge the gap between monarch and subject."

 LCT_cult_of_the_prince:0 "The Cult of the Prince"
 LCT_cult_of_the_prince_desc:0 "In olden times, the Grand Prince stood at the centre of Lake City's affairs. He was a monarch who ruled absolutely, with his decisions being beyond the realm of criticism. Few would dare oppose him, and many gave their complete admiration and devotion. While our modern monarchy is a long way from these ideals, we can begin to rebuild this cult of personality."

 LCT_reaffirm_the_treaty:0 "Reaffirm the Treaty"
 LCT_reaffirm_the_treaty_desc:0 "The Coltstream Treaty has been a lynchpin to our foreign and domestic policy since it's inception, providing us with the means to defend against Griffon aggression. However, since the rise of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow, there have been growig fears amongst treaty members that our political shift could jeopardize the alliance. We must put these fears to rest."

 LCT_blessed_sowrds_legacy:0 "Blessed Sword's Legacy"
 LCT_blessed_sowrds_legacy_desc:0 "Blessed Sword was the first Grand Princess of Lake City. She was a brilliant general, skillful diplomat, and cunning strategist, who unified the tribes around our lake, turning a meager city-state into a growing power. It's time to capitalize upon her legacy, by promising to take Lake City into a new era of greatness."

 LCT_youth_army:0 "Royal Guard"
 LCT_youth_army_desc:0 "The Royal Guard of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow are an elite fighting force who are prepared to sacrifice all in defense of their monarch. This has given them a prestigious reputation throughout the land. While few will ever have the honour of serving within this elite unit, it will not stop many from enlisting in the hopes that they will one day make the cut."

 LCT_reorganise_the_military:0 "Reorganize the Military"
 LCT_reorganise_the_military_desc:0 "Due to the power of the military, and their vital role in the royal coup, the Grand Prince was initially unable to interfere in the affairs of the army. However, the Grand Prince's power has finally grown to the point where he can now safely purge the military of its last vestiges of republicanism and anti-monarchist sentiments."

 LCT_princely_glory:0 "Princely Command"
 LCT_princely_glory_desc:0 "Previously, the Grand Prince and Minister of War were two separate Ponies within Lake City. However, by combining these two positions into one, we can position the military directly subordinate to the crown. Thus, Heavenly Snow can ensure their loyalty, and command his forces without the interference of his generals or ministers."

 LCT_anti_griffon_propaganda:0 "Reaffirm who the Enemy is"
 LCT_anti_griffon_propaganda_desc:0 "The February 4th coup, and the period of instability which followed, distracted us from who our real enemies are. To our south and west, lie the hordes of Griffonkind, readying themselves to invade our lands. As such, we must unite our Ponies behind the leadership of our Grand Prince for the struggle ahead."

 LCT_buckrovic_incident:0 "The Buckrovic Incident"
 LCT_buckrovic_incident_desc:0 "There is a significant population of Ponies living across the border in the County of Longsword. However, this minority has often bore the brunt of Griffon bigotry and barbarism. As tensions between this community and the Griffon majority rise, there are fears that these communities may be targeted for systematic attack."

 LCT_strike_at_the_source:0 "Emperor Versus Prince"
 LCT_strike_at_the_source_desc:0 "Griffon versus Pone, Griffon versus Pone, everypony wants to see this happen!"

 LCT_regency_council:0 "Wild Tree's Regency"
 LCT_regency_council_desc:0 "Heavenly Snow may hold the strongest claim to the throne of Lake City, however he still has much to learn before he is truly capable of assuming the duties of his office. Until such a time, Wild Tree will continue to act as regent, handling the affairs of state until Heavenly Snow feel fully capable of taking responsibility."
 
 LCT_demand_DEP:0 "Demand Deponyan Loyalty"
 LCT_demand_DEP_desc:0 "Prior to Grand Princess Raging Breeze's exile, she was destined to marry King Longbow of Deponya. However, the marriage fell through upon her exile, as the King had no interest is marrying a landless mare. It might be 150 years late, but it's time to repay the Ponies of Deponya for this egregious insult."
 
 LCT_subjugate_the_guilds:0 "Subjugate the Guilds"
 LCT_subjugate_the_guilds_desc:0 "In 852, the Guilds were the chief benefactors of the revolution which ended the First Lake City Kingdom. Since then, they've profited generously from the instability of the republican era. It's about time that we break the power of the Guilds, and ensure their loyalty for decades to come."
 
 LCT_princely_welfare:0 "Princely Charity"
 LCT_princely_welfare_desc:0 "We could make great strides in bridging the gap between our new regime and the common citizen, with the sacrifice of a small portion of the Prince's personal wealth towards charity projects. Who knows, these may even help alleviate the crushing poverty of Lake City."

 LCT_increase_military_funding:0 "Increase the Military Budget"
 LCT_increase_military_funding_desc:0 "If it wasn't for the military, our Princely Restoration would've never seen the light of day. Now we must call upon the military once more, to defend our fragile monarchy against our foes, both foreign and domestic. To accomplish this feat, we must raise defense spending to never before seen levels."
 
 LCT_DEP_railways:0 "Deponyian Railways"
 LCT_DEP_railways_desc:0 "There are rumoured to be vast quantities of crystals within the depths of the Eygsic Forest. However, access to this remote region is pitiful, with only a few dirt roads penetrating deep into the perilous forest. It's imperative that we develop a rail line to service these lands, in order to properly exploit the crystals for our own benefit."
 
 LCT_forced_industrialization:0 "Deponyian Development Aid"
 LCT_forced_industrialization_desc:0 "Our neighbour to the north suffers from a severly stunted economy, with the vast majority of their population toiling away in the fields just for mere sustenance. We must come to our vassal's aid, offering them loans, technical expertise, and guidance to kickstart their industrial revolution."
 
 LCT_DEP_forts:0 "Secure Deponya"
 LCT_DEP_forts_desc:0 "While the transition of power was smooth between our two regimes, the local populace of Deponya has shown some resistance to our leadership. In order to further secure our influence over the population, we must construct fortified strongpoints throughout the land in order to leave a permanent reminder of our governance over them."
 
 LCT_Resource_harvesting:0 "Develop Zemun Basin Aluminum Production"
 LCT_Resource_harvesting_desc:0 "The Zemun River makes up the border between Lake City and Deponya. It's well known, that along this river, there are massive quantities of aluminum. While our own domestic reserves are currently inaccessible, due to the river's flow, the Deponyians are far luckier, having an easy to exploit supply just begging to be developed."
 
 LCT_DEP_research:0 "Lake City - Deponyian Royal Research Society"
 LCT_DEP_research_desc:0 "While our northern vassal is economical and militarily inferior to our kingdom, they do wield a significant class of scholars, researchers, and other intellectuals. We could greatly benefit from creating an instituion to pool together the collective brain power of our two realms into a single organization."
 
 LCT_anti_griff_research:0 "Joint Military Research"
 LCT_anti_griff_research_desc:0 "Currently, research into military matters is dispersed between our domain and Deponya. This means that a lot of research is redundant, with resources being wasted on 'reinventing the wheel'. We could greatly streamline our development process by sharing research between our two realms and jointly working on projects."
 
 LCT_divine_sacrifice:0 "Divine Sacrifice"
 LCT_divine_sacrifice_desc:0 "Death should be seen as an honourable sacrifice to make for your Grand Prince. It's also a sacrifice which will be greatly rewarded. For, as your mortal life ends, you'll soon discover that the next offers a whole new realm in which to serve His Majesty. Your mortal soul is merely a prolouge to an eternity of service and rewards."

 LCT_pony_on_throne:0 "Grand Emperor Heavenly Snow"
 LCT_pony_on_throne_desc:0 "With the Griffon Emperor's defeat, his title now lies within our hooves. The burden of picking his successor now falls upon us, and we can think of no better candidate than our own beloved Grand Prince. While the idea of a Pony Emperor, of a Griffon Empire, might seem strange, our Griffon subjects will soon come to love and respect His Majesty."

 LCT_reclaim_river:0 "Down with the Coalition"
 LCT_reclaim_river_desc:0 "At one point, the River Coalition was the most important aspect of our foreign policy. However, the once mighty military organization has fallen upon hard times, leaving the Ponies of Eastern Griffonia vulnerable to Griffon barbarism. We must seize the lands of our former allies in order to ensure their safety against the horrors of Griffonkind."
 
 LCT_east_griffon_sphere:0 "Found the East-Griffonia Sphere"
 LCT_east_griffon_sphere_desc:0 "The River Coalition has become too bloated and bureaucratic, busying themselves with their quest towards integration and drafting useless social policies. By creating the East-Griffonia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we can offer an alternative for River Coalition members willing to distance themselves from the organization."
 
 LCT_for_the_prince:0 "For the Prince!"
 LCT_for_the_prince_desc:0 "Every solider should be prepared to sacrifice fully in the name of their Grand Prince. This is the benefit of a monarchy. In a monarchy, our army is not a collection of individuals, but rather a single mightly organic entity aligned in its admiration and devotion to its liege. If we militarize this philosophy fully, there will be few who can stand against us."
 
 LCT_princely_divinity:0 "His Heavenly Presence"
 LCT_princely_divinity_desc:0 "The devotion expected of the army must be extended to the civil sector. The Ponies of Lake City should realize that they do not work for their personal benefit, but rather, towards the benefit of His Majesty, and his imperial ambitions. Once this has been achieved, there will be little hindering our economic hegemony."

 LCT_river_empire:0 "A River Empire" 
 LCT_river_empire_desc:0 "From Nimbusia to Deponya, from the Zebralands to Farbrook, our domain stretches across the entirety of Eastern Griffonia. However, our lands are far too large for a mere Prince to govern. It's about time that we organize our inheritance into an imperial title that rivals that of the Griffon Emperor."
 
 LCT_student_movement:0 "The Citizens Youths"
 LCT_student_movement_desc:0 "The Citizens Youths are an organization open to all foals within Lake City. They are an extracurricular group which organizes field trips and sports leagues for young foals. When the foals grow up, the Citizens Youth will begin to teach discipline, preparing our younger generation for a future of military service and loyalty to the state."
 
 LCT_workers_movement:0 "Sacrificing for a Better Future"
 LCT_workers_movement_desc:0 "It is the duty of everypony to contribute their all towards the health and wellbeing of Lake City. In the short term, this may result in longer workdays and heavier workloads, but in the long term, Lake City will flourish as a result of this sacrifice."

  ### WESTERLY ###

 LCT_vanguard_restores_order:0 "The Vanguards Restore Order"
 LCT_vanguard_restores_order_desc:0 "During the coup of February 4th, Springtime Frost was forced between a rock and a hard place. In an act of desperation, he called upon Westerly Leeward, who was able to swiftly restore order with the aid of the Republican Vanguards. However, the streets are now patrolled by forces loyal to Westerly, and his presence is felt heavily in day-to-day life."

 LCT_westerly_takes_control:0 "Unify with the Military"
 LCT_westerly_takes_control_desc:0 "There is much tension between our administration and the army, with the old guard being highly wary of the paramilitary branch of our party. We can put these stuffed shirts at ease by offering them cabinet positions while offering to formally integrate our paramiltary wing into the traditional military structure."
 
 LCT_military_guilds:0 "Nationalize the Guilds"
 LCT_military_guilds_desc:0 "For decades, the guilds of Lake City have worked against the common interest of our Ponies, making a profit through their suffering. We must seize the assets of these traitors and wield them in a manner that benefits our nation, army, and Ponies."
 
 LCT_secure_loyalty:0 "Secure Officer Loyalties"
 LCT_secure_loyalty_desc:0 "While our policy of unity, with the army, has addressed the worst of our administration's growing pains, we still have critics within the military. If we were to strong-hoof these individuals into an early retirement, and replace them with party loyalists, we could further integrate the Republican Vanguards and army."
 
 LCT_expand_military:0 "Universal Conscription"
 LCT_expand_military_desc:0 "As the terrors of war approach our border, it becomes the duty of every able-bodies Pony to serve their country. To aid in this endeavour, the government of Westerly Leeward has called for universal conscription, with a minimum of two years service required for all Ponies over the age of 21."
 
 LCT_citzenship_under_service:0 "Republican Vanguard Foreign Battalions"
 LCT_citzenship_under_service_desc:0 "In its early days, the River Coalition was a defensive alliance against Griffon aggression. This has bred a deep seeded xenophobia of Griffons amongst many coalition citizens. We can capitalize upon this by creating the Republican Vanguard Foreign Battalions, offering service to Ponies, with anti-Griffon sentiments, from beyond our realm."
 
 LCT_ban_school:0 "Politicize the Jezeragrad Military Academy"
 LCT_ban_school_desc:0 "The officers of tomorrow are the cadets of today. As such, we could make great strides in securing the military's loyalty by interfering in the affairs of Jezeragrad Military Academy. This can be done by limiting enrollment, so only party members can join, and by altering the curriculum to take on a pro-Vanguard bias."
 
 LCT_national_mobilization:0 "National Mobilization"
 LCT_national_mobilization_desc:0 "In the near future, our nation will be in a state of total war against the terrors of the Griffon world. Our armies will be engaged in a fight for their very survival, and they will require the resouces of our entire society if we are to endure. As such, we must begin mobilizing our nation in preparation for such a day." 
 
 LCT_military_austerity:0 "Military Austerity"
 LCT_military_austerity_desc:0 "Under the prior guidance of the guilds, the resources of our nation were wasted away with little benefit to Lake City. Our administration will reverse this course of action by prioritizing the use of resources towards the benefit of our military and society over providing luxuries to a few traitorous elites."
 
 LCT_prepare_for_war:0 "Operation: Rushing Waters"
 LCT_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "Operation: Rushing Water is the codename given to a hypothetical directive created by the Westerly government. It calls for the nationalize of key civilian industries and the conversion of their productive assets towards armament production. These weapons will then be used to supply the rapid mobilization of our population."
 
 LCT_military_science:0 "Military Science Committee"
 LCT_military_science_desc:0 "The underdeveloped nature of both the Lake City science base and economy has limited the amount of resources we can contribute towards research. The creation of a dedicated committee on military science would properly manage these resources and make sure none are wasted on frivolous things, such as wonder weapons."
 
 LCT_national_science_funding:0 "National Science Fund"
 LCT_national_science_funding_desc:0 "Lake City is full of intelligent Ponies with great ambition. Unfortunately, the poverty of our nation has denied many of them access to proper research facilities. We can resolve this by creating a National Science Fund which will provide grants to Ponies and firms willing to innovate for our society."
 
 LCT_fan_fanaticism:0 "Fanaticism within our Ranks"
 LCT_fan_fanaticism_desc:0 "Those who serve within Lake City's army should not only be prepared, but eager, to lay down their lives in the name of their country. By bringing political officers to the front, we can better educate our soliders on the bravery, ferocity, and loyalty that is expected of every Lake City solider."
 
 LCT_balustar_arms:0 "Bolster our Arms Industry"
 LCT_balustar_arms_desc:0 "The eve of our final struggle is upon us, yet our military is still woefully underequipped for the conflict ahead. To address this, we must push for our most comprehensive economic policy yet. Our steel mills must be nationalized, our arms industry expanded, and the flow of precious materials, out of our country, stopped."
 
 LCT_expand_frontier:0 "Secure the Zemun River Basin"
 LCT_expand_frontier_desc:0 "The Zemun River is the lifeblood of the River Coalition. It provides water to millions of acres of cropland and is the transit corridor that links together every nation of our alliance. In fact, it is this rive that gives our Equine Union its very name. Yet, the source of this river lies within Griffon lands. This injustice must be corrected."
 
 LCT_defend_frontier:0 "Defend the Frontier"
 LCT_defend_frontier_desc:0 "The recent expansion of our frontier has forced our armies to move beyond the safety of their defenses. In order to ensure the security of these units we must invest heavily into the construction of new fortifications."
 
 LCT_own_the_frontier:0 "Department of Settlements"
 LCT_own_the_frontier_desc:0 "To our west lies the former lands of the County of Longsword, a region lightly populated by Griffons. It's also a land rich in fertile pastures just waiting to be exploited. That's why our government is setting up a dedicated department of settlements, to fill lands, like these, with Pony settlers."
 
 LCT_greater_lake_city:0 "Greater Lake City"
 LCT_greater_lake_city_desc:0 "The scourage of Griffon aggression has been pushed back on every front, giving us some much-needed breathing room. However, we've moved far beyond the days of being a mere Lake 'City'. It's about time that we formally acknowledge that."
 
 LCT_destroy_true_enemy:0 "Destroy the True Enemy"

 LCT_strike_the_south:0 "Stabilizing the South"
 LCT_strike_the_south_desc:0 "The regimes to our south are unstable entities who are just one revolution away from becoming a threat to our sovereignty. We must act swiftly and exploit their instability in order to secure these lands for our benefit."
 
 LCT_exploit_plains:0 "Exploit the Plains"
 LCT_exploit_plains_desc:0 "The lands to our south are poorly surveyed but are thought to hold a bounty of resource wealth. If we were to invest into properly surveying these lands, we could possibly find a plethora of resources vital to our war effort."
 
 LCT_own_the_south:0 "Crystal Rush"
 LCT_own_the_south_desc:0 "The discovery of crystals in Cessabit has triggered a crystal rush, with thousands of Ponies lifting up their roots and voluntarily moving to the former Griffon lands in search of wealth. While most of these settlers will find nothing of value, they will fulfill the very important duty of filling our newly acquired lands with loyal Ponies."

 LCT_strike_the_red_scourge:0 "The Red Menace"
 LCT_strike_the_red_scourge_desc:0 "With the bulk of Griffon lands in Eastern Griffonia safely under our control, only a single threat remains. The Griffon Liberation Army was a feeble entity mere years ago, but has ballooned rapidly into a threatening powerhouse. We must strike, while its advantageous, and remove this final bastion of Griffon aggression from the map."

 ### "Democracy"! ###
 
 LCT_democracy_prevails:0 "Democracy Prevails"
 LCT_democracy_prevails_desc:0 "Quick thinking by a military detachment, loyal to our civilian government, secured the safety of Grand Mayor Springtime Frost. The rebels loyal to 'Grand Prince' Heavenly Snow were then quickly surrounded and within a few hours overwhelmed and captured. Heavenly Snow is now imprisoned and the election season can safely resume."
 
 LCT_placate_the_militery:0 "Placate the Military"
 LCT_placate_the_militery_desc:0 "To appease the military, and prevent future coups, our government proposes the creation of special seats within the council exclusively for military representatives. This would ensure that the military has a voice in future decision-making."
  
 LCT_support_the_guilds:0 "Supporting the Guilds"
 LCT_support_the_guilds_desc:0 "The Guilds of Lake City make up the backbone of our economy, providing thousands with employment and financing a significant portion of our government's expenditures. However, the guilds are a partisan force and have been known to throw in their lot with the SDP. It would be greatly beneficial for our administration to try and win over their support."
 
 LCT_fortification_studies:0 "Fortification Studies"

 LCT_propaganda:0 "Nationalistic Propaganda"
 LCT_propaganda_desc:0 "The Ponies of Lake City should be reminded of the sacrifice our soliders endure on a daily basis, in defense of their country. They should also be made aware of the valour and honour they'll earn through enlistment and service."
 
 LCT_militery_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 LCT_militery_industrial_complex_desc:0 "The military infastructure of Lake City is severly underdeveloped, leaving our armies inadequately equipped. We can partially address this issue by contracting the Guilds to produce our weapons and other military equipment."

 LCT_west_wall:0 "Construction of the Western Wall"
 LCT_west_wall_desc:0 "To our west lies the County of Longsword, formerly a member of the accursed Griffon Empire. Since the empire's downfall, the county has acted as a staging ground for raiders seeking to loot our lands. The construction of a wall against them would greatly hinder such activities."
 
 LCT_national_research_council:0 "The Chamber of Innovation"
 LCT_national_research_council_desc:0 "The military has requested that we establish a chamber of innovation.

 LCT_army_work_groups:0 "Army Work Groups"
 LCT_army_work_groups_desc:0 "There is much work to be done in the name of national defense. Fortifications must be built, arms factories manned, and infastructure constructed.

 LCT_south_wall:0 "Construct the Southern Wall"
 LCT_south_wall_desc:0 "To our south lies the Gryphian Host and the Princeipality of Lushi. The former is a group of glorified bandits organized into a supposed government.

 LCT_empower_the_guilds_desc:0 "While the monopolisitic nature of Lake City's guilds have brought much pain to our working class, their unyielding support of the SDP can not be ignored. In order to ensure their continued support, we must reward them with additional resource charters."

 LCT_free_healthcare:0 "Socialized Healthcare"
 LCT_free_healthcare_desc:0 "Our current healthcare system locks access to quality medical care behind barriers which only the middle and upper-class can access.

 LCT_curtail_the_militery_desc:0 "After the events of February 4th, the military's role within Lake City's affairs has come into question.

 LCT_expand_public_funding:0 "Shuffling Around the Budget"
 LCT_expand_public_funding_desc:0 "Previously, our military expenditures made up an incredibly high portion of our annual budget.

 lakecity.1.a:0 "For the City!"

 lakecity.2.t:0 "The Elections of 1007"
 lakecity.2.d:0 "1007 is an election year in Lake City, and this year promises to be one of the most vicious in recent years. With Grand Mayor Springtime Frost's unwillingness to seek re-election, two Ponies have come to the forefront of the campaign, Wavebreaker and Westerly Leeward.\n\nWavebreaker is seen as the more traditional candidate, with a policy that favours greater cooperation with the River Coalition and increased social spending to alleviate the poverty of the city. This platform has garnered him the support of both the moderate, Constitutional Democratic Party, and the left-leaning, Social Democratic Party.\n\nWesterly Leeward, on the other hoof, is seen is seen as a more extremist candidate. He calls for increased military spending and a greater roll for the military within the affairs of state. While these beliefs are radical, he is able to easily tap into the rampant anti-Griffon sentiments of Lake City, playing upon the lingering phobias of its Ponies. His party, the Republican Vanguards, also operate a paramilitary wing, allowing him to intimidate his opposition.\n\nLastly, there are whispers from within the military, which state that there are certain officers who wish to return Lake City to its monarchistic roots. While these radicals should be discredited as a tiny minority, it can not be ignored that within recent months, the pretender, 'Grand Prince' Heavenly Snow, has been unaccounted for by our intelligence agencies."
 lakecity.2.a:0 "Let's hope it goes smoothly."

 lakecity.3.t:0 "Wavebreaker Gives his Speech"
 lakecity.3.d:0 "In front of a massive crowd outside of Jezeragrad's largest theatre, Wavebreaker gives another of his pre-election speeches.\n\nHis platform is two-fold. First, he will seek greater security against the Griffon Empire through deeper cooperation amongst the members of the River Coalition. Second, he demands the creation of a generous social welfare system which will protect the citizen's of Lake City from poverty, ill-health, and unemployment.\n\nWhile his speech is seen as lackluster, pollsters believe that Waverbreaker's election is assured with his backing from both the SDP and CDP."
 lakecity.3.a:0 "United, we are strong!"

 lakecity.4.t:0 "Westerly Speaks out Against Griffon Aggressions"
 lakecity.4.d:0 "Today, Westerly Leeward, leader of the Republican Vanguards, held a speech in Pristinaigh. This settlement lies mere kilometers from the border with the County of Longsword and has, for generations, been a prime location for Griffon bandits looking to gain wealth and prestige through plunder.\n\nIn his speech, he played into these heavy anti-Griffon sentiments, promising the denizens of the city safety through increased military spending and greater border security.\n\nHis speech was well recieved, with a quarter of the city's population attending the rally. Pollsters put the province of Coltsovo firmly in Leeward's camp. Though, he still has much ground to gain on Wavebreaker."
 lakecity.4.a:0 "We'll stop those Griffons!"

 lakecity.5.t:0 "The February 4th Incident"
 lakecity.5.d:0 "February 4th started like any other day in Jezeragrad. Merchants opened their shops, restaurants prepared meals, factory workers shuffled to their mills, and bureaucrats reported to their offices.\n\nHowever, at around 10am, a column of troops entered the city from the North. At first this was ignored, as the presence of soliders is an all too familiar sight within the city. However, this perception rapidly soured when the troops stormed the city's central police station, disarming and imprisioning its officers. This was followed immediately by the occupation of key military offices and certain civil instituions.\n\nSoon there were reports of gunfire in the streets, as this column fired upon the garrison protecting the council chambers.\n\nIt was at this point that a broadcast was made from the city's state-run radio station. The speaker was the coup leader, General Wild Tree. He gave a speech to the city's resident, stating that the Grand Prince's long-awaited return had finally arrived and that, with the assistance of his royal retinue, he was prepared to seize the apparatus of state from the traitorous civilian government.\n\nHowever, Grand Mayor Springtime Frost still remains free, though his office is under siege. Before him are three options. The first, is that a military battalion loyal to him is currently prepared to intervene and evacuate him out of the city. This would guarantee his safety but could be seen as an abandonment of the city to the rebels. The second, is that he can call upon Westerly Leeward and the Vanguards. These paramilitary bands could easily overpower the prince's retinue. However, to do so would put the Grand Mayor at their mercy. Finally, there is surrendering, with the hope that the military loyal to him can swiftly achieve victory and liberate him."
 lakecity.5.a:0 "Secure the Mayor and surrounded the rebels!"
 lakecity.5.b:0 "Send in the Vanguard! They'll stop them!"
 lakecity.5.c:0 "There is little we can do."

 lakecity.6.t:0 "The Civilian Government Endures"
 lakecity.6.d:0 "While the coup was successful in capturing a majority of government instituions within Jezeragrad, they were unable to capture the Grand Mayor. He managed to escape the city, with a portion of his cabinet, and set up a temporary provisional government.\n\nThis inability to capture the Grand Mayor spelled doom for the coup, as the loyalist army soon regrouped and launched a counter-offensive into the city. Within a matter of hours, the coup was surrounded and disarmed, following a short-pitched battle.\n\nAs night falls, fighting has been restricted to a small stronghold in the suburbs, with the coup's leadership now in custody."
 lakecity.6.a:0 "Let's hope this is the last of our drama."

 lakecity.7.t:0 "Aftermath of the Coup"
 lakecity.7.d:0 "Springtime Frost made the call, allowing Westerly Leeward to mobilize his paramilitary bands. Within a few hours, the royal retinue of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow found themselves embroiled in fierce fighting with the Republican Vanguards. Street by street, the Vanguards slowly pushed the coup back towards a few pockets of stiff resistance near the waterfront.\n\nBy day's end, the coup has been virtually defeated and now the streets are patrolled by units loyal to Westerly. As the sun sets, Westerly Leeward takes to the stage before a crown of nervous Ponies. The main question for many, is what has happened to Springtime Forst? And what will the future bring?"
 lakecity.7.a:0 "Springtime Frost survived and Westerly is demobilizing his bands."
 lakecity.7.b:0 "Springtime Frost died and Westerly will assume temporary mayoral powers."

 lakecity.8.t:0 "Return of the Prince"
 lakecity.8.d:0 "Springtime Frost's decision not to flee the city resulted in the Princely Restoration Front capturing the Grand Mayor, and significant portion of his cabinet. With the civilian government effectively cripple, the Lake City army is faced with a crisis. As an organization, they have always been independent of government control, which has put their loyalty into question.\n\nThese fears were confirmed, as units neutral to the crisis began joining the Prince's faction. By nightfall, only a few stubborn battalions continued to hold out in the name of democracy. Though they would not last long against the overwhelming might of the Prince's retinue.\n\nBy morning, all was calm in Jezeragrad as an assembly was gathered outside of Fort Hoofboka, the former keep of the old Lake City royal family. The speaker was a little known General by the name of Wild Tree. He claimed to represent the Prince and stated that he'd be assuming the duties of regent during this transitional period. In his declaration, he stated that the Kingdom of Lake City was offically restored, and that the traitors in the civilian government executed."
 lakecity.8.a:0 "So ends 150 years of democratic rule."

 lakecity.9.t:0 "The Election of 1007"
 lakecity.9.d:0 "After the attempted coup of February 4th, life has quickly returned to normal within Jezeragrad. As such, Springtime Frost has formally stepped down as election day arrives. While there are some reports of intimidation at the polls, the election has progressed smoothly. Turnout is reported high, and exit polls show the winner to be..."

These diplomats showed little restraint in their dialog and claimed to have only a single demand for the King. Their request was that King Grimhoof pledge allegiance to Grand Prince Heavenly Snow, as set out in a treaty signed nearly 150 years ago by their predecessors.\n\nThe King, seeing his hopelessness in the face of Lake City's superior army, folded at the request and formally submitted, promising us troops, tribute, and loyalty in future endeavours."

The Lake City general sent a list of demands to the town's garrison commander essentially demanding that all griffons withdraw from the town and the surrounding area.\n\nThe stalemate continued until the Lake City troops, supported by the town's residents, opened fire one the guards and stormed the walls. A group of knights managed to raise the nearby levies and rally them against the invaders. As of this morning, an official communiqué from the Lake City government has been received demanding the total withdraw of [Root.GetName] from all lands east of the River Panacea. There is no doubt that refusing this offer will result in war between us."
 lakecity.13.a:0 "We will not let ponies tell us what to do!"
 lakecity.13.b:0 "We must fall back to save ourselves."

 lakecity.14.d:0 "In the Early Hours of yesterday morning, a refugee from the occupied town of Buckrovic crossed the border and begged Lake City troops to help save them from the griffon knights who were massacring the ponies in the town.\n\nHorrified by this act of barbarism, the General ordered his troops across the border to save as many ponies possible. The Prince, in his mightily wisdom, has seen fit to support this action and has sent a demand to the Knights to ceases all hostile actions and withdraw from pony lands.\n\nUnfortunetly, this demand was rejected and the Knights have sent their troops, including pony slaves, to fight against us."
 lakecity.14.a:0 "Just as planned."

 lakecity.15.d:0 "In the Early Hours of yesterday morning, a refugee from the occupied town of Buckrovic crossed the border and begged Lake City troops to help save them from the griffon knights who were massacring the ponies in the town.\n\nHorrified by this act of barbarism, the General ordered his troops across the border to save as many ponies possible. The Prince, in his mightily wisdom, has seen fit to support this action and has sent a demand to the Knights to ceases all hostile actions and withdraw from pony lands.\n\nThe Knights saw the error of their ways and quickly retreated to the River Panacea, handing over ownership of the occupied lands to us."

While initially successfully, the coup was unable to capture the Grand Mayor, who managed to escape the city.
