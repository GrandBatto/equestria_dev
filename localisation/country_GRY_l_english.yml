### National Focuses ###
 GRY_raid_brodfeld:0 "Raid Brodfeld"
 GRY_raid_brodfeld_desc:0 "Normally, it would be against our pact with the Griffonian Emperor to raid Brodfeld. However, central authority has crumbled in recent decades, and no Imperial Official has appeared to demand tribute or renewal of our oaths in over a decade. It is safe to assume that the Emperor will not stop us from taking advantage of Brodfeld's instability to line our pockets..."
 GRY_raid_radicals:0 "Raid The GLA"
 GRY_raid_radicals_desc:0 "Ordinarily, we're not supposed to raid anyone west of the river, but surely that doesn't apply to vicious, anti-monarchist radicals? Besides, this "Communism" thing is appealing to an unsettling number of our youth, and it would be good to damage them however we can."
 GRY_prywhen_response:0 "The Red Menace"
 GRY_prywhen_response_desc:0 "The GLA have managed to defeat the King of Brodfeld! This is a terrible threat, for they will surely turn their attention to us soon. We have to do something!"

They have announced various reforms, intended to transition our society to a proper, Communist utopia."
 GRY_centralise:0 "The Struggle For Succession"
 GRY_centralise_desc:0 "With Hetman Bulba's death, the country has fallen into disarray. Many candidates vie for the title of Hetman, but two are emerging as clear frontrunners - Grifnitsky with his supporters in the Viskyo Griffonskoe, and Yevin Krawvelets, the old Hetman's great-nephew."
 GRY_chorna_rada:0 "The Black Rada"
 GRY_chorna_rada_desc:0 "Przekleństwo! The ideological conflict between the two candidates has riled the Rada to a stronger violence than usual, and now their supporters are murdering each other on the streets of Kaiv.

 GRY_raid_season_desc:0 "The time has come to organise the yearly raid. \n\nHetman Calas Bulba has ordered the clan leaders to gather their warriors and assemble on the Brodfeldian border.

 GRY_agrarian_future:0 "Physiocracy"
 GRY_agrarian_future_desc:0 "Physiocracy, or fiziokratiya, is a philosophy from Aquileia which states that all wealth comes from nature, and specifically, agriculture.

 GRY_land_reform_1:0 "Seize Noble Property"
 GRY_land_reform_1_desc:0 "The decadent nobles have done nothing but argue over petty differences and squander their wealth on frivolities.

 GRY_second_universale:0 "Proclaim Our Foreign Policy"
 GRY_second_universale_desc:0 "Now that we have reorganised our state in the proper socialist fashion, it is time to decide how to treat our neighbours at large. Our hardliner faction believes that we should follow our comrades in Prywhen, but the more independently minded members of the party think we should follow our own path. Comrade Khurshevich has the final say in the matter, however."
 GRY_spread_the_revolution:0 "Revolution Without Borders"
 GRY_spread_the_revolution_desc:0 "While we are very grateful to our benefactors from Prywhen, they do not see that the revolution must be spread to our neighbours, by peaceful change or forced conversion. The oppressed workers will be free!"

 GRY_wittenland_attackit:0 "Our Ancient Enemy"
 GRY_wittenland_attackit_desc:0 "The unicorns of Wittenland are nothing but a bourgeois menace, leeching upon the hard work of their proletariat. The time has come to end their endless partying and exploitation." 
 GRY_ask_GRW:0 "Petition Prywhen"
 GRY_ask_GRW_desc:0 "Wittenland is a land that has been constantly oppressed by reactionaries - but unfortunately, they are well protected by the River Coalition. With the assistance of our allies, we would have a much better chance at defeating them, but they may prove reluctant to go to war against the entire Coalition..."
 GRY_wittenland_makefriends:0 "Reach Out To Volaire"
 GRY_wittenland_makefriends_desc:0 "Glorious news! The proletariat in Wittenland have overthrown their aristocratic repressors and established a socialist state!

 GRY_import_teachers:0 "Invite Educators from Prywhen"
 GRY_import_teachers_desc:0 "Up until recently, the griffons of Prywhen were as uneducated as ours. But the success of the revolution is apparent, and their people are now at the vanguard of socialist thinking. We should request their finest educators to spread the knowledge in Gryphia."

 GRY_volnoye_desc:0 "Borad Grifnitsky, son of a minor noble, has been making great strides in support of Harmony among the people of Gryphia and even some nobles. He believes that by changing our ways for the better, we can become much more wealthier and developed. Many in the Rada don't quite agree with such radical changes, but they'd rather have him over Yevin..."
 GRY_monarchy_compromise:0 "A Revised Monarchy"
 GRY_monarchy_compromise_desc:0 "Despite Black Cloak machinations, the Rada has chosen Borad Grifnitsky for Hetman with a comfortable majority. The price of such, however, was that nobles wouldn't support some of his more sweeping reforms. A compromise is in order."
 GRY_elected_hetman:0 "Let the People Decide"
 GRY_elected_hetman_desc:0 "Yevin and his lackeys have attempted to seize the Rada by force! Fortunately their low numbers and a passionate speech by our new Hetman made them stand down, either out of shame or pragmatism. As his first act, Borad has ordered to organise an election in which every griffon can vote. He believes this will show to the naysayers that Harmony works."
 GRY_reform_starshina:0 "New Senior Staff"
 GRY_reform_starshina_desc:0 "The high command has grown complacent and unsuited for the threaths that challenge our Harmony. New, fresh faces shall be hired."
 GRY_form_government:0 "Appoint the New Government"
 GRY_form_government_desc:0 "Hetman Bulba has left little in the way of actual governance, due to his habit of trying to solve most issues by himself.

 GRY_strengthen_cossack_radas:0 "Increase Tribal Autonomy"
 GRY_strengthen_cossack_radas_desc:0 "It seems that recent events have divided our nation, moreso than usual. Hetman Borad believes that the first step towards an united Gryphia is by giving each clan proper representation."

 GRY_give_land_to_the_people:0 "Land for the Impoverished"
 GRY_give_land_to_the_people_desc:0 "Most of the people in Grpyhia live in abject poverty, having barely any property to their name.

 GRY_placate_clans:0 "Tribal Benefits"
 GRY_placate_clans_desc:0 "Our initial efforts have given results, and the clans are slowly drifting towards complete unification. A few more reforms and benefits shall convince the most stubborn and independently minded clans."

 GRY_compromise_with_rich:0 "Resolve the Noble Concerns"
 GRY_compromise_with_rich_desc:0 "The nobles are concerned with our reforms, and especially with our purchasing of their land. As they are still influential and powerful, we need to settle a compromise, unless we want a rebellion on our claws..."
 GRY_education_reform:0 "Begin the Education Reform"
 GRY_education_reform_desc:0 "Education in Grpyhia has long been the exclusive domain of the wealthy and powerful. This cannot be allowed to continue. Naturally this will require us to build many new school buildings and hire educators from abroad the country. Mandatory school enrollment will be enacted, for the basic education at the least."
 GRY_reinforce_government:0 "Strong Harmonic Government"
 GRY_reinforce_government_desc:0 "The commonfolk of Gryphia are very satisfied with our reforms, and even the nobles, communists and leftovers of the old regimes can't say too many bad things about us. Harmony has taken roots in our land."

 GRY_liberty_from_the_barrel_of_a_gun_desc:0 "Freedom isn't guaranteed for us, with many vying to take over our proud lands. Freedom will be defended, from the barrel of a rifle."
 GRY_our_liberty_will_not_perish:0 "Remind the People"
 GRY_our_liberty_will_not_perish_desc:0 "The people of Gryphia must be taught how precious our liberty truly is! Only then can they understand that they fight for much greater things than land and glory!"

 GRY_federal_investment:0 "Riverpony Investment Program"
 GRY_federal_investment_desc:0 "The impossible has happened! Not only has Hetman Borad returned with positive news, the Riverponies have agreed to invest in our nation!

 GRY_speak_with_GRU:0 "Alliance with Gryphus"
 GRY_speak_with_GRU_desc:0 "The towns of Gryphus are known for their merchants and seafarers, but their military is rather weak. We should approach them for a mutually beneficial alliance."
 GRY_speak_with_GRW:0 "Swallow Our Pride"
 GRY_speak_with_GRW_desc:0 "As much as it is distasteful for many of us, the griffons of Prywhen need to be included as well in our defence treaty. Let bygones be bygones, as our independence is more important than ideology differences."
 GRY_true_hetman:0 "Support for Yevin Krawvelets"
 GRY_true_hetman_desc:0 "Yevin Krawvelets, the late Hetman's grandnephew, is the right choice for our leader. With the backing of wealthy landowners, he will convince the squabbling Rada that only he can bring Gryphia to new glories."
 GRY_proclaim_new_hetmanate:0 "The Rightful Heir"

 GRY_visit_the_people:0 "Public Support for Yevin"
 GRY_visit_the_people_desc:0 "Yevin's rule has already been contested by the nobles, and his popularity is very weak. He has decided the best course of action is to seek support with the commonfolk, explaining them that he is saving Gryphia unlike the treasonous Harmonic supporters."

 GRY_deal_with_traitors_desc:0 "The GSDLR are nothing but Prywhenist agitators sent to undermine the Gryphian nation! So far they have not chosen a side in the civil war, but undoubtedly they plan on striking once we are at our weakest. We must deal with this threat immediately."

 GRY_church_support_desc:0 "The common religion of the griffons is prevalent in Gryphia, but our religious leaders are not as influential compared to the Imperial Heartlands.

 gryphianhost.106.t:0 "Old Wounds Forgiven"
 gryphianhost.106.d:0 "To our great surprise and joy, the Riverponies have seen past the actions of our ancestors, and have recognised our new, Harmonic society. We are now a full-fledged member of the River Coalition!"

 gryphianhost.107.d:0 "Sadly, though not unexpectedly, the Riverponies have rejected our appeal. We cannot look to them for protection, friendship, or security."
 gryphianhost.107.a:0 "We can't say we really blame them"
 gryphianhost.108.t:0 "A Great Change - If It's Real"
 gryphianhost.108.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition - and River City agreed! Though this has evoked protests from many of our citizens, the Gryphians really do seem to have changed, and [Root.GetLeader] assures the people that everything will be alright, and that the Gryphians will be booted back out at the first sign of trouble. While not everyone is happy with the situation, it seems as if they're putting up with it for the time being."

 gryphianhost.109.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition! Thankfully, [From.GetLeader] had enough presence of mind to refuse their offer, not believing their ridiculous claim to have reformed totally."

 gryphianhost.110.d:0 "Scandal! Horror! The Gryphian Host recently made the shocking move to ask for membership in the River Coalition - and [From.GetLeader] LET THEM IN! [Root.GetLeader] has voiced fierce protests at this shocking betrayal of our people. These Griffons have raided, slaughtered, and plundered our people for centuries, and [From.GetLeader] actually believed their nonsensical claims to have reformed? In response, [Root.GetLeader] has formally left the River Coalition, seeing that it clearly does not have our best interests at heart."

 gryphianhost.114.d:0 "Representatives from the [From.GetName] arrived at government buildings today, in a manner which we've never seen them before. Up until now, the Gryphians had been known as fierce raiders, and we didn't much like meeting them, despite our distant ancestral connection. However, in recent years they have reformed their government into a more peaceful one, and have proclaimed interest in forming a "brotherhood of Zaphzans", which will encompass every Griffon of Zaphzan ancestry, including us. Though we haven't called ourselves Zaphzans for over a thousand years, some within our country think the offer is tempting. How shall we respond?"
 gryphianhost.114.a:0 "We will gladly join this initiative"
 gryphianhost.114.b:0 "We'd rather not commit to something like that."
 gryphianhost.115.t:0 "The Question Of The Crown"
 gryphianhost.115.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has thoroughly crushed all opposition and established himself as ruler of the Zaphzans. So great is his power that he might, perhaps, lay claim to the long-defunct title of King of Zaphzia, which would restore the ancient glory of our people. However, we have a long tradition of democratically elected leaders, and it would perhaps be wiser (not to mention less contentious) if he were to simply reaffirm the title of Hetman (though he will not, of course, allow himself to be defeated in an election. That would be silly)."
 gryphianhost.115.a:0 "Hail to the King!"

 gryphianhost.116.t:0 "Fate Of The Reactionaries"
 gryphianhost.116.d:0 "We are in a difficult position regarding our brother-Cossacks. While a fair few of them supported the GSDLR in their revolution, many of them are staunch supporters of the old order. We cannot afford to ignore this issue, for they are some of our most vocal critics, but by the same token, they are also some of our most skilled military staff. We could simply execute them, but such a move would be deeply unpopular and would leave our military defanged and leaderless. Perhaps it would be better to convince them to join us, so as to integrate them into our new Red Army? This would be much smoother and would allow us to benefit from their extensive experience - but could we ever be certain of their loyalty?"
 gryphianhost.116.a:0 "Pardon them and integrate them into the Red Army"

 gryphianhost.117.b:0 "We must stick with our older brothers in socialism"
 gryphianhost.117.a:0 "We will spread the revolution, whether alone or not!"
 gryphianhost.118.t:0 "Kaiv Commune proposes closer ties"
 gryphianhost.118.d:0 "The griffons of Kaiv have thrown off the chains of oppression and established a socialist state by the banks of the River. Seeing that we also have come to see the eminent glory of socialism, they have offered to forge closer ties with us, to ensure peaceful coopoeration between socialists and defend the revolution from hostile foreign powers. However, there is some dispute among our most prominent officials about how far we ought to take this offer. Most are happy to accept Kaiv's offer of protection, but some wish to go further, and directly join with them against the forces of reaction."
 gryphianhost.118.a:0 "It is fine to defend one another, but we each must build our own socialism"
 gryphianhost.118.b:0 "We are small and surrounded by enemies. Perhaps it would be best to join more closely with them"
 gryphianhost.119.t:0 "The Kaiv Commune proposes a joint offensive"
 gryphianhost.119.d:0 "The Kaiv Commune has approached us with a drastic proposal, one that could significantly affect both of our futures. Militarism is growing within their nation, and their people are eager to spread the Revolution immediately, and by force. This would not be a problem, were it not for the fact that they wish to attack their neighbor, Wittenland. Ruled by a corrupt elite, Wittenland is certainly reactionary and worthy of being destroyed, but they are also protected by the entire River Coalition. A war against them would almost certainly call down the fury of the Riverponies upon our heads, a prospect we cannot take lightly. If we are going to discourage them from this attack, we had better do so now, and forcefully."
 gryphianhost.119.a:0 "Support the offensive! The riverponies must see the light of Communism also!"
 gryphianhost.119.b:0 "This is far too risky, it is insanity! Order them to back down"
 gryphianhost.120.t:0 "[From.GetName] backs us"
 gryphianhost.120.d:0 "Our proposal has been heard and accepted by our ally. [Root.GetName] has agreed to join us in the great struggle to free the workers of Wittenland."

 gryphianhost.121.t:0 "[From.GetName]'s ultimatum"
 gryphianhost.121.d:0 "Our ally has heard our proposal, and responded swiftly. They have stated in no uncertain terms that an attack upon Wittenland would result in the destruction of both their nation and ours, and they categorically refuse to help us in any such endeavour. They have presented us a stark choice - give up our goals on Wittenland, or have our alliance formally severed."
 gryphianhost.121.a:0 "Cowards! We will not be dissuaded like this! To war!"
 gryphianhost.121.b:0 "We cannot afford to ruin our relationships with our friends like this - back down on our claims"
 gryphianhost.122.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] severs ties"
 gryphianhost.122.d:0 "The Kaivans have not listened to us, scorning us for our "cowardice" and "revisionism". [From.GetLeader] has formally severed ties with [Root.GetName], and plans for the invasion of Wittenland are proceeding apace."
 gryphianhost.122.a:0 "Those stubborn fools!"
 gryphianhost.123.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] backs down"
 gryphianhost.123.d:0 "Under our threat, [From.GetLeader] has withdrawn their hostile rhetoric towards Wittenland, and quietly shelves their plans for an invasion. It seems that peace, for now, has prevailed."
 gryphianhost.123.a:0 "At least we won't be dragged into a stupid, unwinnable war"
 gryphianhost.124.t:0 "Re-establishing Contact"
 gryphianhost.124.d:0 "While we cut ourselves off from the outside world during the war, now that we have successfully proven that we can in fact defeat the Riverponies, we should re-open communication."
 gryphianhost.124.a:0 "At last"
 gryphianhost.125.t:0 "Reactionary Uprising!"
 gryphianhost.125.d:0 "Terrible news! Our seizure of substantial parts of their estates has enraged the aristocrats, and our indecision in decisively stripping away their power has enabled them to rise up. They have banded together with disaffected elements within the military, as well as anti-communists the countryside over, and declared their intent to topple the Government and restore the old Hetmanate. Chaos descends upon our lands, as we slip into civil war..."
 gryphianhost.125.a:0 "The Revolution shall triumph!"
 gryphianhost.125.b:0 "Glory To The Hetman!"
 gryphianhost.126.t:0 "Officers Defect!"
 gryphianhost.126.d:0 "More bad news! We have never been entirely sure of the loyalty of the old officer corps, but they seemed content to work for us in the past. Little did we know that this was only a ruse to buy time! Now that reactionary forces have risen up the overthrow Communism, several of our most skilled generals have defected, declaring their loyalty to the new Hetman and his army."
 gryphianhost.126.a:0 "We should have purged them when we had the chance"
 gryphianhost.127.t:0 "[From.GetName] joins us"

 gryphianhost.127.a:0 "May our friendship last a thousand years!"
 gryphianhost.128.t:0 "[From.GetName] turns us down"
 gryphianhost.128.d:0 "Diplomats from [From.GetName] have arrived at government headquarters today, bearing sad news. The leaders of their country have decided against joining together with us in an alliance of mutual defense and trade."
 gryphianhost.128.a:0 "What a Disappointment"
 gryphianhost.129.t:0 "The Gryphian Host Betrays Its Oath"
 gryphianhost.129.d:0 "To our dismay, the Gryphian Host has violated its oath of loyalty by invading a country that is officially part of our realm. Our guarantees of defense with them are now null and void, and Imperial subsidies to their lands have been frozen indefinitely."
 gryphianhost.129.a:0 "What a pack of traitors!"
 gryphianhost.130.t:0 "We Have Betrayed Our Oath"
 gryphianhost.130.d:0 "Our recent act of war was a clear violation of our treaty to His August Majesty the Emperor. By declaring this invasion, [Root.GetLeader] has placed us all in grave danger. Our guarantees of defense with the Empire are now null and void, and Imperial subsidies to our lands have been frozen indefinitely."
 gryphianhost.130.a:0 "Perhaps this wasn't a good idea..."
 gryphianhost.131.t:0 "The Hetman Request The Restoration of the Border March"
 gryphianhost.131.d:0 "Long ago, Grover I, the august founder of the Empire, made a deal with the Cossacks of the far eastern Riverbank. He would protect them from the predations of the hostile riverponies, in exchange for their loyalty and a cut of the profits from their frequent raids on enemy territory. This agreement was followed for centuries, but in recent decades we have been too weak to enforce payment of the tribute or to prevent minor raids on our nominal subjects. Today, however, seeing our increased strength, the Hetman of the Host has sent an envoy to Griffenheim, asking for the restoration of his people's status as an Imperial March. They will defend the Empire's borders and attack our enemies, in exchange for funding and promises of protection should they be attacked by hostile forces."
 gryphianhost.131.a:0 "So the Cossacks have finally come home, have they? Reinstate the March!"
 gryphianhost.131.b:0 "We don't care about that land anymore"

 gryphianhost.132.d:0 "To our joy, the Emperor has accepted our request to become an Imperial March. So long as we do not transgress upon the Empire's rightful domain (including territories currently held be disloyal rulers), we should be okay. (NB: Your war declaration screen will warn you if you are about to declare war on someone you're not allowed to)."
 gryphianhost.132.a:0 "Hail the Emperor!"
 gryphianhost.133.t:0 "The Emperor's Scorn"
 gryphianhost.133.d:0 "Sadly, the Emperor has expressed no interest in restoring our status as a border march. It seems he does not care about us, or about the riverland anymore."
 gryphianhost.133.a:0 "How unfortunate"
 gryphianhost.134.t:0 "The Darts Of Fate"
 gryphianhost.134.d:0 "Alas! While being carried by his soldiers during a celebration after their recent raid, Hetman Bulba was shot by a Communist sharpshooter! A dozen Cossacks immediately apprehended the villain and tore him to shreds on the spot, unable to contain their sheer fury, but the damage has been done. The Hetman died instantly, the musket-ball passing cleanly through his brain. His death has killed the normally-joyful mood of victorious warriors, and the raiding party has borne his body home in the old custom, carried on the shoulders of his most devoted warriors. Hetman Bulba led us for over forty years, and he was highly-regarded by all. Worse, he died without leaving a clear heir, meaning that the election of the next Hetman is bound to be fraught with turmoil."

 gryphianhost.135.t:0 "The Darts Of Fate"
 gryphianhost.135.d:0 "Alas! While comforting some of the wounded warriors of his band, despondent after their failed raid, Hetman Bulba was shot by a Communist sharpshooter! A dozen Cossacks immediately apprehended the villain and tore him to shreds on the spot, unable to contain their sheer fury, but the damage has been done. The Hetman died instantly, the musket-ball passing cleanly through his brain. His death has been the last and greatest tragedy on this failed excursion, and the raiding party has borne his body home in the old custom, carried on the shoulders of his most devoted warriors. Hetman Bulba led us for over forty years, and he was highly-regarded by all. However, without the funding that was intended to come from this raid, it is doubtful whether the country will be able to prevent itself from devolving into anarchy and turmoil. Hetman Bulba was the last thread holding together this fractured society, and now that thread has snapped. Anarchy is loose, and the most organised and violent party will win the day."

 GRY_117_GRW_faction:0 "At last, we have finished stabilising our country, and established the beginnings of a true socialist state in Gryphia. However, now we face the very important issue of our foreign policy. While we are grateful to our friends in the People's Republic Of Prywhen, there is division among the Rada about how closely we should tie ourselves to them. The supporters of Khurshevich hold that it would be best to tie ourselves further to Prywhen, for the world is large and filled with people who hate us, and it would be foolish to strike out on our own and risk alienating our only reliable ally. However, his opponents have criticised this policy, calling it "revisionist" and claiming that Comrade Khurshevich simply lacks with courage to stand up to the forces of reaction."
