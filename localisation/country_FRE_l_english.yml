 #### Focuses ####
 FRE_begin_rapid_industrialisation:0 "Rapid Industrialisation"
 FRE_begin_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "Our nation is a poor backwater compared to our neighbours. Our ponies live in poverty and work long hours just to survive. The Taioseach has come up with an ambitious plan to industrialise the country, but many of the clanns and especially the monks oppose these ideas, since they will break with tradition."

 FRE_call_for_reform:0 "Call for Reform"
 FRE_call_for_reform_desc:0 "Some would consider our nation a poor backwater compared to our neighbours. But we are rich in tradition and happier for it. Our ponies live in poverty and work long hours just to survive. Although the Taioseach has grand ambitions to improve the standard of living, she must restrain herself to ensure that we stay true to what is dear to us."

 FRE_invite_foreign_experts:0 "Invite Foreign Experts"
 FRE_invite_foreign_experts_desc:0 "We don’t have the know-how to develop a modern, industrialised society. However, our friends are able to help. Many of the ponies around us have made amazing new discoveries and some of them might be willing to help Pònaidhean."

 FRE_invite_wittenland_teachers:0 "Invite Wittenland School Teachers"
 FRE_invite_wittenland_teachers_desc:0 "Wittenland is a beacon of learning and science. Their Unicorns might be a tad decadent, but they make up for it in intelligence. Who better to teach the ponies of our tribes things like reading and mathematics? Some traditionalists think that the ponies should stay and work the land or be taught the ancient ways by the monks, but we cannot stay in the past forever."

 FRE_land_reformes:0 "Land Reforms"
 FRE_land_reformes_desc:0 "The way land is distributed between Clanns and the way the Commons Lands are distributed is based on ancient verbal agreements and memory. This often leads to disagreements over who owns what, which in turn leads to good land staying unused. By sending fair surveyors to settle land disputes and to write down who owns what, we will finally settle the issue of land."

 FRE_agriculture_reformes:0 "Agricultural Reforms"
 FRE_agriculture_reformes_desc:0 "By using modern farming techniques we can ensure all our ponies have enough food to eat all year round, as well as freeing up valuable time from working the fields. Pònaidhean fashion products are sought after luxury products in the Riverlands, produced locally by our farmers. With more food and more local industry, we can free up more of our own industry for other projects."

 FRE_long_term_economic_planning:0 "Long Term Economic Planning"
 FRE_long_term_economic_planning_desc:0 "Planning short term is sure to lead to disaster. We must plan far into the future to ensure that we build the best society we can. Now that we can ensure food security, we can start planning bigger projects more easily. We must make sure, however, that our projects don’t thread over ancient sacred sites."

 FRE_develop_arms_industry:0 "Develop an Arms Industry"
 FRE_develop_arms_industry_desc:0 "The big outside world is not only full of the wonders of technology. We have learned about the many other nations who desire to rule large domains and who will not stop until the last free peoples on Equus are enslaved. We simply must develop our local smithies and armouries into true arms factories, if we are to have a chance in the world."

 FRE_tartan_mass_production:0 "Tartan Mass Production"
 FRE_tartan_mass_production_desc:0 "Our fabrics are our most sort after commodity. We should find a way to mass produce these fabrics to ensure we have an ample supply to trade. Although this will force many of our artisans to move to cities for a factory job, it will leave our nation better off in the end."

 FRE_welth_of_the_mountains:0 "The Wealth of the Mountains"
 FRE_welth_of_the_mountains_desc:0 "The towering peaks of our beautiful country have laid untouched for so long. Many monks make these places their residence and many legends abound about our mountains. However, legends and monasteries won’t help us. We must blow open these ancient vaults and seize the wealth that is stored there for ourselves!"
 
 FRE_iron_stallion:0 "The Iron Stallion"
 FRE_iron_stallion_desc:0 "Trains are large metal beasts that pull carriages full of cargo and ponies. We should ensure that these beasts reach every corner of our nation. Everypony will be connected with the capital and with the wide world beyond it. We are all Pònaidheans after all!"

 FRE_reforme_monastic_schools:0 "Reform the Monastic Schools"
 FRE_reforme_monastic_schools_desc:0 "The Anam-Teine Monks have long provided education to our nation's young. We should encourage all ponies to learn from them. There is still much to be learned from our past and by working together with the Monasteries to make education more accessible, we will finally be able to tackle the burden of illiteracy."

 FRE_encourage_free_enterprise:0 "Encourage Free Enterprise"
 FRE_encourage_free_enterprise_desc:0 "Our ponies are still a bit weary of the new influences of the industrial revolution, so we must teach them some self-confidence. Our country is full of ponies with great ideas, they just need the courage to act on it and start their business, so that our economy can grow!"

 FRE_non_disturbance_policy:0 "Non-Disturbance Policy"
 FRE_non_disturbance_policy_desc:0 "The Triaths or chiefs of some of the clanns have given notice that they do not feel the need to engage in our renewal policy. Who are we to go against the wishes of these tribes? Let us enact a policy of non-disturbance, leaving the clanns in the highlands of Pònaidhean be."

 FRE_reach_out_to_the_tribes:0 "Reach Out to the Lost Tribes"
 FRE_reach_out_to_the_tribes_desc:0 "We should include everypony in our efforts to modernise. If we do it with respect and patience, we will be able to convince even the far-flung stubborn pony tribes of our good intentions. Let us despatch emissaries and monks to talk to the Triaths and address their clann’s issues."

 FRE_drag_them_into_the_future:0 "Drag Them into the Future"
 FRE_drag_them_into_the_future_desc:0 "There are those who still cling to the own ways. We must show them that the path to the future is the only correct path for our survival. Those stubborn countryside ponies must be taught the modern ways, even if they protest. Let us rid of archaic traditions and privileges and leave our tribal past behind."

 FRE_power_to_the_taioseach:0 "Power to the Taioseach"
 FRE_power_to_the_taioseach_desc:0 "The Prìomh Chomhairle has long served us well, but the constant bickering between Triaths and Toisiches leads to little being done. More power must be given to the Taioseach to ensure that our petty differences do not get in the way of progress."

 FRE_a_new_clann:0 "A New Chomhairle"
 FRE_a_new_clann_desc:0 "The Prìomh Chomhairle has long served us well, but it must be reformed to allow it to become a more inclusive and meaningful form of government, fit for the modern age. We will change representation based on democratic vote, instead of tribal allegiance, which will allow the ponies themselves to have a say in government!"

 ### ARMY FOCUSES ###

 FRE_native_army:0 "A Native Army"
 FRE_native_army_desc:0 "For our defence, we cannot rely on others, not even our closest friends. Pònaidhean will make her own armed forces and everypony will be ready to defend our ancient homeland and the magic that resides within!"

 FRE_keep_the_old_ways:0 "Keep to the Old Ways"
 FRE_keep_the_old_ways_desc:0 "The mystical and wise monks have often taken to defence of our country, against monsters and even threats from the Otherworld. Naturally, we must incorporate their age-old traditions into our armed forces, so that our soldiers can benefit from their wisdom."

 FRE_national_army:0 "Pònaidhean National Army"
 FRE_national_army_desc:0 "We will reorganise the armed forces for the modern days. In the old days our forces were based on the Ceithearn skirmishers and ritual combat between monks. But in this new age, we will require a national professional army to protect our dear Pònaidhean an Taigh-Fada!"

 FRE_monks_in_the_army:0 "Integrate the Anam-Teine Monks"
 FRE_monks_in_the_army_desc:0 "The monks are already well trained in the arts of combat and will provide a sturdy core of elite troops for our army. Their knowledge of our sacred land and their magical connection to it will mean that they will prove them to be our unwavering sentinels."

 FRE_secrets_of_anam_teine:0 "The Secrets of Anam-Teine"
 FRE_secrets_of_anam_teine_desc:0 "The ancient magic of Pònaidhean’s monasteries, Anam-Teine, holds many secrets. One of these is the ritual to summon an Anamarm or soul weapon. By letting our monks study the ancient lore of magic, they will be able to enhance their magic, making our army even more formidable."
 
 FRE_trade_with_breezies:0 "Trade with the Breezies"
 FRE_trade_with_breezies_desc:0 "The Breezies live in magical realm parallel to ours, home to a never-ending amount of pure magic crystals. We should strike a trade deal for these crystals. We will send our most quick-witted speakers to negotiate, since the Breezies sometimes delight in trickery and we don’t want anypony to accidentally sell their firstborn!"

 FRE_magic_guns:0 "Weaponized Spirit Energy"
 FRE_magic_guns_desc:0 "The spirits that live all around us are powerful. Mere weapons of steel cannot harm them, but their energy may still be used. If we capture the spirits and make their energy ours, we will be able to create powerful magical artefacts as weapons."

 FRE_soul_weapons:0 "The Power of Anamarm"
 FRE_soul_weapons_desc:0 "An Anamarm–or Soul Weapon–is a physical representation of a pony's soul used to defend themselves and others from harm. Learning how to harness your Anamara is a rite of passage for hopeful Anam-Teine monks. We should ensure that this skill is taught to all our warriors."

 FRE_local_officer_school:0 "Our Own Officer School"
 FRE_local_officer_school_desc:0 "We cannot rely on Triaths to lead our troops by tribal tradition. We must educate a new generation of officers in the modern way and that means founding our own officer school. Let us study the art of war, so that we may protect the peace."

 FRE_trible_militias:0 "Integrate the Tribal Levies"
 FRE_trible_militias_desc:0 "We must integrate our tribal levies, regiments and units into the national army. If we are to make sure everypony can join the army, there is much to standardise. Uniforms, standards, weapons, equipment and food rations. For some tribes, the entire chain of command needs to be overhauled, or even constructed from nothing!"

 FRE_weapon_development:0 "Modern Firearms"
 FRE_weapon_development_desc:0 "We must develop modern firearms, if we are to arm our non-magical troops as well as our monks. Luckily, our blacksmiths are quick to adapt to being gunsmiths!"

 FRE_artillery_development:0 "Bring out the Big Guns"
 FRE_artillery_development_desc:0 "It appears that modern warfare has the same principles as our own. A bigger weapon is more effective. Let us develop this idea by making large calibre cannons for our army and using their longer range to pummel our enemies."

 FRE_mountain_home:0 "Our Mountain Home"
 FRE_mountain_home_desc:0 "We are the Ponies of the mountains! Many of our tribes live in the highlands, in places others would call inhospitable. We should use this "
